It might not have seemed that way in the first two notebooks because our domains were quite tiny, but consider this:  for a domain with $nx = ny = 128$, the Jacobi method will require nearly *70000* iterations before the residual dips below $10^{-8}$.\n",

Now consider this:  an incompressible Navier Stokes solver has to ensure that the pressure field is divergence-free at every timestep.  One of the most common ways to ensure that the pressure field is divergence-free is to *relax* the pressure field using *iterative methods*!  \n",
