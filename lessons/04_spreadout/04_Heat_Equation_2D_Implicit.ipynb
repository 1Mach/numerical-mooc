We know explicit schemes have stability constraints that might make them impractical in some cases. We presented implicit schemes, which are unconditionally stable, in [notebook 2](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/blob/master/lessons/04_spreadout/02_Heat_Equation_1D_Implicit.ipynb), looking only at 1D. Already, that was quite a lot of work: setting up a matrix of coefficients and a right-hand-side vector, while takign care of the boundary conditions, and then solving the linear system. And now, we want to do implicit schemes in 2D\u2014are you ready?"

      "A function that maps `i` and `j` into `row_number` would be handy, right? How about `row_number = (j-1)*(nx-2)+(i-1)`? By feeding `i` and `j` to that equation, you know exactly where to operate on the matrix. For example, `i=nx-2, j=2`, which is in row `row_number = 2*nx-5`, is next to a Neumann boundary condition: we have to substract one out of the main diagonal (`A[2*nx-5,2*nx-5]-=1`), and put a zero in the next column (`A[2*nx-5,2*nx-4]=0`). This way, the function can become much simpler!\n",

      "Can you use this information to construct a more general function `generateMatrix`? Can you make it such that the type of boundary condition is an input to the function? "
